                    <p>The Bug Bounty Hunter Job Role Path is for individuals who want to enter the world of Bug Bounty Hunting with little to no prior experience. This path covers core web application security assessment and bug bounty hunting concepts and provides a deep understanding of the attack tactics used during bug bounty hunting. Armed with the necessary theoretical background, multiple practical exercises, and a proven bug bounty hunting methodology, students will go through all bug bounty hunting stages, from reconnaissance and bug identification to exploitation, documentation, and communication to vendors/programs. Upon completing this job role path, you will have become proficient in the most common bug bounty hunting and attack techniques against web applications and be in the position of professionally reporting bugs to a vendor.</p>

                    <p>In this path, modules cover the basic tools needed to be successful in network and web application penetration testing. This is not an exhaustive listing of all tools (both open source and commercial) available to us as security practitioners but covers tried and true tools that we find ourselves using on every technical assessment that we perform. Learning how to use the basic toolset is essential, as many different tools are used in penetration testing. We need to understand which of them to use for the various situations we will come across.</p>

                    <p>To be successful in any technical information security role, we must have a broad understanding of specialized tools, tactics, and terminology. This path introduces core concepts necessary for anyone interested in a hands-on technical infosec role. The modules also provide the essential prerequisite knowledge for joining the main Hack The Box platform, progressing through Starting Point through easy-rated retired machines, and solving "live" machines with no walkthrough. It also includes helpful information about staying organized, navigating the HTB platforms, common pitfalls, and selecting a penetration testing distribution. Students will complete their first box during this path with a guided walkthrough and be challenged to complete a box on their own by applying the knowledge learned in the Getting Started module.</p>
